\section{Conclusion}
Our application, \SOP{}, is working as a proof-of-concept with most basic and necessary functionality implemented and serves as an example of how the system could be designed, but the software is not ready for production as explained more in-depth in the appendix (see Appendix \ref{sec:limitationsandfuture}).

Some of the primary concerns to be addressed in the future would be to add more security and user handling, which would focus on more authentication checks primarily in web client, better handling of password storage in the database, and a more usable user creation process. We would also like to improve the merger functionality, which is one of the most central parts of this system, as the current implementation in most instances is too simple and does not provide as effective merging as desired. This would also include a more thorough handling of conflicts from the current very simple notification provided visually in the local client to a more noticeable actual UI functionality for choosing specific lines to keep from both our and their versions.

In general we are very satisfied with the product we have created, as it effectively serves as a working proof-of-concept that clearly shows the idea behind it and enables us to easily modify it with further functionality, general improvements, and bug fixes we find prudent.

Through the process we have gained a much more thorough insight to Scrum and the process of iterative software development and we feel that this process has contributed to a successful proof-of-concept in a short timespan.
