\section{Conclusion}
Our application, \SOP{}, is working as a proof-of-concept with most basic and necessary functionality implemented and serves as an example of how the system could be designed, but the software is not ready for production as described in-depth in the appendix (see Appendix \ref{sec:limitationsandfuture}).

Some of the concerns to be addressed in the future would be security and user handling, focusing on authentication in the web client, better handling of password stored in the database, and a more explicit user registration process. We would also like to improve the merger functionality, which is one of the most central parts of this system, as the current implementation is too simple and does not provide as useful merging as desired. This would also replace the current visual conflict-indication in the local client with a more functional solution, aiding the user in the actual conflict resolution.

In general we are very satisfied with the product we have created. It serves as a working proof-of-concept that clearly shows the idea behind the \SOP{} system, and builds a foundation for both designing and implementing further functionality. 

Through the process we have gained experience and insight into the RUP artifacts, Scrum, and the process of iterative software development. This process has contributed to a successful proof-of-concept, designed and implemented in a short period of time.
