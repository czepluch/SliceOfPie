\section{Conclusion}

Our incarnation of the SliceOfPie project was built with two separately executable versions, a desktop version
and a web-based version. Both share the majority of their respective codebases.

SliceOfPie keeps one consistent state in a separately hosted database that both versions of the software access.

During the development, the concept has been analysed and several approaches and software patterns have been
discussed.

As a proof-of-concept the software is not ready for production (see Appendix \ref{sec:limitationsandfuture}), but
serves to proove that the concept is executable.
