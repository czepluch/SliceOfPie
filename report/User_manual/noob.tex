This is the guide for the noobs on how to make make a section for the report
and include it in the report.tex file.

First you have to make a file in the folder where you want your section to be located.
This file can be written in pure text and must be saved as .tex.

When you want to add the section to the report you go to the report.tex file 
and make three lines like the three lines under "Table of Content".
If you need a subsection use the four lines located a bit further down that also
includes a line with "subsection".
