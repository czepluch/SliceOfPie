This report covers our examn project for the mandatory \emph{Analysis, Design and Software Architecture} course at our third semester at the BSc in Software Development at the IT-University of Copenhagen. This project took place in November and December in the year 2012. 

The main purpose of this project is to document the making of an interactive document sharing system, called Slice of Pie, which merges some of the functionality of Google Drive with the synchronizing functionality of Dropbox.
 
Like Google Drive, Slice of Pie allows the user to create, edit, and share documents through a web interface. Documents can be arranged into projects and folders. The modifications of shared documents are merged together.

Like Dropbox, Slice of Pie, gives the user the possibility to synchronize the entire Slice of Pie library into a local folder. A stand-alone client application is provided which can perform the same operations as the web client. The difference is that now the user can also work offline.

Unlike Dropbox, Google Drive and the likes, our application is limited to simple text files and the client is built into a text editor.

Our advisors throughout this project were been Jacob Bardram and Dario Pacino.
We have also received feedback from our teachers assistant, Simon Bang Terkildsen, who has been of great help to us.
