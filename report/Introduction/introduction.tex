This report covers our exam project for the mandatory \emph{Analysis, Design and Software Architecture}
course at our third semester at the BSc in Software Development at the IT-University of Copenhagen.
This project took place in November and December in the year 2012. 

Our advisors throughout this project were been Jacob Bardram and Dario Pacino. We have also received feedback from
our teachers assistant, Simon Bang Terkildsen, who has been of great help to us.

\paragraph{The Problem}
The main purpose of this project is to document the making of a \textbf{proof-of-concept} of an interactive document
sharing system, called Slice of Pie, which mixes some of the functionality of Google Drive and Dropbox with
an integrated text editor.

The problem is elaborated further and specified in our Software Analysis section (\ref{sec:software-analysis}).

\paragraph{Our Slice}
Like Google Drive, Slice of Pie allows the user to create, edit, and share documents through a web interface.
Documents can be arranged into projects and folders. The modifications of shared documents are merged together.

It gives the user the possibility of having a local client and all files in a local version. A stand-alone client
application is provided which can perform the same operations as the web client. With the local client, the user
can also work offline.

Unlike Dropbox, Google Drive and the likes, our application is limited to simple text files (allowing HTML syntax).
