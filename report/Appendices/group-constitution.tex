\section{Group Constitution}
\label{sec:group-constitution}

The following are our agreements in the group as to when we meet, how much work we put into our project and the likes.

The group consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Jacob Czepluch (jstc)
    \item Michael Storgaard (mmun)
    \item Niclas Tollstorff (nben)
    \item Niels Abildgaard (nroe)
    \item Sigurt Dinesen (sidi)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Meetings}
As a basis, we agree on two meeting every week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, but are open for other meetings placed ad hoc. It is important that people do not limit themselves to two meetings, and are generally open to more meetings. We meet Tuesdays from 10 to around 16 and Thursdays from 12 to around 18.

Breaks are as a starting point agreed ad hoc, when we need them. If this turns out to be a problem we are open to including breaks into meeting schedules.

This also fits the fact that there is dinner in the canteen from 16-18 every day. Nice!

\subsection{Work Ethics}
When working in groups we expect that all participants are focused on the task at hand. This goes for both meetings and pair programming.

\subsection{Level of Ambitions}
We aim high and shoot for the stars. Play hard, live hard.

It is important that people are open with how much they can deliver and are quick to report if they are moving towards a period in which they will have less time. It is also important to be flexible and willing to produce more in periods where it is direly needed.
