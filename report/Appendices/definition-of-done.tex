\section{Definition of Done}
\label{sec:definition-of-done}

A part of the system (use case/backlog entry/story) is done when...
\begin{itemize}
    \item it is working
    \begin{itemize}
        \item and has been reviewed through at least one run-through
    \end{itemize}
    \item it is tested thoroughly
    \begin{itemize}
        \item and at least one other person has approved the thoroughness of the tests
    \end{itemize}
    \item it is documented (non-trivial situations explained in diagrams)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item and older artifacts regarding this part have been updated
        \item and all non-trivial classes have been documented and commented
    \end{itemize}
    \item it is integrated
    \begin{itemize}
        \item and has been committed to the master branch
        \item and all tests are still running after integration
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This definition goes for code. In the case of user interface code, unit tests are not necessary.
