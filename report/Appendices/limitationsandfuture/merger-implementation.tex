\subsection{Merger implementation}
\labes{sec:merger-implementation}
The merger, in its current implementation, always yields a document that is equivalent to the newest of the input documents.
This is not entirely usefull, but serves as a template for for more complex sollutions. An improvement building directly un the current implementation could be to produce a document that lets the user know what has been changed between 
versions. A more satisfying sollution could be a three-way merge algorithm, but that lies beyond  the scope of this report.
