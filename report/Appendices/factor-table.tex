        Web \& Desktop UI &
        Same things must be possible on both versions of the system. Measured through use. &
        Simple API in Controller makes this easy. May be extended to use a different backend without breaking functionality &
        Accessible everywhere &

        \hline
        Most operations < 2 sec &
        UnitTests of these actions have timing. &
        Optimization may be possible by swapping Entity Framework for Web Service &
        Usability (respon\-sive\-ness) &

    \caption{Factor table. Refer to the Supplementary Requirements (Appendix \ref{sec:Supplementary Requirements}) for the requirements
        that have been factored in here. Some of the factors can only be measured or are only relevant in production environment, and
        have not been measured. They are here for completeness, and to be easily taken into use when the system reaches production.}
