\subsubsection{Daily Scrums}
During the Sprints we had regular very short meetings (10-15 minutes) which was focused on the team members updating each other and coordinating work according to the current status on items in the Sprint Backlog. In a work environment this meeting should happen every workday, but due to other courses we had them scheduled for tuesday, thursday and either saturday or sunday. Our Daily Scrums were based on the three points (1) What has been accomplished since the last meeting?; (2) What will be done before the next meeting?; and (3) What obstacles are in the way?

If any any obstacles were present it was our ScrumMaster's job to help resolve them. Any resolving of problems happened \emph{after} the Daily Scrum had finished in order to keep the meeting itself very precise and to the point, as to not waste the whole Team's time.
