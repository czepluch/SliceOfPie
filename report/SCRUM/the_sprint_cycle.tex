In our (close to) one month project period we managed to fit in tree one-week Sprints as well as a short preparing \textit{Sprint Zero}, as is sometimes used in Scrum. The Sprint Zero was focused on the discussion of our vision for the product, identifying initial items for the Product Backlog, providing a minimal environment that enables the  writing of quality code, and other preparation we saw fit e.g. group constitution.

Sprint Zero aside, we made use of Scrum specific meetings and progress tracking tools in our Sprints. In this section we will elaborate on the work process with these tools.


\paragraph{Sprint Planning Meetings} 
Every Sprint was prepared by two short meetings (one hour each).
