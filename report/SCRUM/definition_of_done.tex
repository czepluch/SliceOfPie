\subsubsection{Definition of Done}

In Scrum the output of a Sprint should be a \textbf{Potentially Shippable Product Increment}. As such it is essential to define this term before starting the first Sprint as to avoid any misunderstandings. The Product Owner, Scrum Master and Team discuss this definition and captures it in a \textbf{Definition of Done}.

Our Definition of Done can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:definition-of-done}.
