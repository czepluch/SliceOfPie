\section{Testing}
Testing in our system is primarily based on automated unit tests and manual structured client tests. We chose this kind of test with the intention of gaining confidence in our code and program in general. With this approach we achieve a thorough testing of the individual smaller parts of the system, while maintaining confidence that all the parts works in unison and as intended, as we systematically go through each functionality in the client program. Using automated tests enables us to regression test effectively upon implementing new features.
