In addition to the class diagrams we picked out two of our use cases that we thought to be critical for the system. For each of these we made an interaction diagram
to make sure that these parts of the application are implemented correctly. 

The purposes of our interaction diagrams are to visualize the interactive behaviour of our system. Interaction diagrams help us capture the dynamic behaviour of 
the system. It also describes the message flow in the system, the structural organization of the objects, and the interaction among objects.
