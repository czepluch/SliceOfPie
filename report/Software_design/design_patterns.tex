In software, design patterns are \emph{ideas} or \emph{concepts} of how to structure code that are easily applicable
in different situations. Design patterns include everything from simple, basic patterns (such as the ones found in
GRASP) stretching all the way very advanced patterns for organizing applications.

The purpose of this section is to highlight some of the patterns that have been applied in the design of SliceOfPie.

The general use of the Model-View-Controller pattern and Layered architecture pattern in the structure of SliceOfPie
is described in Section \ref{sec:logicalview}.
