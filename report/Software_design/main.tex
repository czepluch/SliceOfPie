\section{Software design}
In this section, the design process of the 'Slice of Pie' project and its artifacts will be explained and documented.

We will go over the \emph{Class Design Diagrams}, \emph{Interaction Diagrams}, and a variety of \emph{Design Patterns} used for the 'Slice of Pie' project.

The main purpose of software design in the development phase of an application is to give the software development team an overall guidance of the architecture of a software project.
