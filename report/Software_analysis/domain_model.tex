Most of the entities in the \SOP{} domain have been identified by looking for nouns in our use cases, revision being the exception.
The domain model (\ref{fig:domain-model}) contains the core entities of the \SOP{} system, and the transition from domain to software entities (as seen on figure \ref{fig:design-class_diagram} on page \pageref{fig:design-class_diagram}) is simple and almost linear.
Notably, the \emph{Content} attribute of \emph{Document} is actually a \emph{Revision} in 
its own right. Only it denotes the current version of the document's contents, while the relation to the \emph{Revision} entity forms a history for the document.
