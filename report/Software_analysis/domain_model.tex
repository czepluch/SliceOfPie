Most of the entities in the \SOP{} domain have been identified by looking for nouns in our use cases, revision being the exception.
The domain model (\ref{fig:domain-model}) contains the core entities of the \SOP{} system, and the transition to runtime entities (as seen on figure \ref{fig:design-class_diagram} on page \pageref{fig:design-class_diagram}) is obvious, except perhaps the application of the composite pattern.
