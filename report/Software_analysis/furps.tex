Our Supplementary Requirements document (Appendix \ref{sec:Supplementary Requirements}, page \pageref{sec:Supplementary Requirements}), somewhat colored by the project description, covers requirements not described in the use cases. 
Noteworthy requirements are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Functionality --- refining the requirement of having both a local and web UI. As well as a merging requirement.
\item Usability --- providing guidelines for interface design.
\item Reliability --- stating that the synchronization process must be resilient.
\item Security --- dictating a secure management of user authentication data.
\end{itemize}
The \emph{functionality} stands out, because it refers directly to a demand in the project description.
The subject of security is further discussed in detail in Appendix~\ref{sec:limitationsandfuture}.
