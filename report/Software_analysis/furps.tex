Our furps+ (functionality, usability, Reliability, Performance, Supportability, etc.) document (appendix \ref{sec:Supplementary Requirements}, page \pageref{sec:Supplementary Requirements}), somewhat coloured by the project description, covers requirements not described in the use cases. 
Noteworthy requirements are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Functionality --- refining the requirement of having both a local- and web-ui. As well as a merging requirement
\item Usability --- providing guidelines for interface design
\item Reliability --- stating that the synchronisation process must be resilient.
\item Security --- dictating a secure management of user authentication data.
\end{itemize}
The \emph{functionally} stands out, because it refers directly to a demand in the project description, and because it is omitted from the use cases.
The discussion section goes further into detail on the subject of security.
