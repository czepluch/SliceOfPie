Our use-case artifacts, refer appendix \ref{sec:use-cases}, address simple, user-oriented, system-critical, use cases.
Omitted from the usecases (and the use case diagram in particular) are the secondary actors, such as authorization systems and central storage.
They have been omitted for simplicity, as all the use cases would point out to the same central storage after authenticating. Duplicates for distinguishing between web- and local-ui are omitted as well.
