\section{Software analysis}
\label{sec:software-analysis}
This section describes our use of the software analysis' artifacts, as according to the RUP model taught in the course, and described in [OOAD] \cite{Larman2011}.\\
The analysis and design processes are somewhat heterogeneous, Though they differ in purpose and emphasize different artifacts, the transition between analysis and design is often seemless and builds on revisiting the analysis artifacts.
