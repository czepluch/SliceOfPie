\subsection{Logical View}

The architecture is based around a reusable application logic layer, that connects to the
local file system and a MySQL database as needed. Additionally, it can easily be used by
both the Web-Only UI and the Local UI.

\end{figure}

Because of this structure, we have an architecture that is split in that it supports two
parallel UI layers and two parallel data layers (see Figure \ref{fig:application-layers}).

From these layers our package diagram almost directly follows (Figure \ref{fig:package-diagram}).
To communicate with the different data layers, we have two separate models. It is important to
note that the \emph{LocalFileModel} connects to both the file system (in most situations) and
to the MySQL database (when this is explicitly requested).

With the overall architecture in place, the last important logical component of the architecural design
consists of the basic classes that all packages use (Figure \ref{fig:basic-classes}): \emph{Document},
\emph{Folder} and \emph{Project}. These are mostly defined in their implementations of \emph{IItemContainer}
and \emph{IItem}. \emph{IItem} defines an "item"; something that can be contained in an
\emph{IItemContainer}. This is important as Folders may both \emph{contain} and \emph{be contained},
whereas Documents may only be contained and Projects may only contain.
