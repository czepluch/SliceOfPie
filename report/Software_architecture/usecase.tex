\subsection{Use case view}

The most interesting use case view, from an architectural standpoint, is the way threading is handled
to allow for a smooth user-experience. The user-experience is additionally enhanced by the way the
LocalClientUI automatically updates views to represent the most current state.

An example of this is detailed and explained in Appendix \ref{sec:usecasescenarios}. The technique
is the same for all calls from the ClientUI.

From the WebUI the calls are not sent through the APM system as all requests are already handled on
separate threads before they reach the Controller. Additionally, there is no need for asynchronous calls:
The request will not return until the data has been fully retrieved. Such is the nature of the Hyper-Text
Transfer Protocol, HTTP, which is used on websites.
