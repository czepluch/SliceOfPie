\subsection{Implementation view}
\label{sec:implementationview}

The source code of the project can be found on GitHub at\newline http://github.com/hypesystem/SliceOfPie/app .

The solution is built into several different files, reusing code as best possible.

\begin{description}
	\item[SliceOfPie.dll] This library contains the general \SOP{} centric code. It is built into a
        DLL to be easily distributable between all interested clients. Apart from defining the common
        language used in the UIs (Documents, Folders, Projects), it also defines the API for the
        Controller, which, in effect, gives access to the data of the application.
    \item[SliceOfPieClient.exe] This executable is simply the desktop UI. It comes bundled with
        SliceOfPie.dll, and provides an easy interface to use the application through.
    \item[MvcWebApp.dll] This DLL is an MVC project, that can be hosted on so-enabled Windows servers.
        It depends on an MVC3 installation being present and comes bundled with SliceOfPie.dll.
    \item[SliceOfPieTests.dll] This DLL is never actually released and contains tests for SliceOfPie.dll.
