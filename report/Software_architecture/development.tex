\subsection{Development View}

The software has been developed with a version control system (VCS) called Git\cite{progit},
originally developed by Linus Thorvalds.

This version control system emphasises agility and the ability to concurrently work on serveral
things at once, branching the source code by features, and joining the branches again only when
features are done\cite{sopBranching}.

Our source code is hosted at GitHub, a Git repository host.

Our report is written in \LaTeX\cite{latexBook} and is part of the project as its content has been developed
side-by-side with the application.

\subsubsection{Preliminary Requirements}

It is recommended to use the Visual Studio 2010 IDE and the Git VCS.

Before compiling the source code of the project there are a few requirements for the setup:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item MySQL Connector/Net\footnote{Available from MySQL: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/};
        allowing the application to talk with the MySQL server.
    \item ASP.NET MVC 3 Tools Update\footnote{Available from Microsoft: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=1491};
        enabling the WebUI to run.
\end{enumerate}
