\section{Software Architecture}

The following is akin to a Software Architecture Document (SAD) \cite[p.~655-659]{Larman2011} and as such
it contains different perspectives (views) on the most important parts of the overall architecture
of the SliceOfPie system.

Certain factors have impacted the architectural design of the application. An overview can be found in the factor
table (Appendix \ref{sec:factor-table}).

There are additional requirements for the application that are taken into account during the development
of the system. An overview of these may be found in Appendix \ref{sec:Supplementary Requirements}.
