\subsection{Decisions}

In SliceOfPie, there is a deeply founded MVC structure, in that the model and controller are
compiled to a library that can be used by any user interface that wishes to do so, though a
simple API (in the Controller).

There has been an emphasis on simplicity, and prooving that the concept works. This means that
not all aspects of the application are currently at a production-grade level, but the infrastructure
is there to support changes that would bring them to that required level.

Several other decisions and the reasoning behind them are detailed in section \ref{sec:discussion}.
