3 May. Bistritz. Left Munich at 8:35 p. M., on ist May, ar- 
riving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 
6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful 
place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the 
little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far 
from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near 
the correct time as possible. The impression I had was that we 
were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western 
of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width 
and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule. "
